                   Taught children and teenagers fundamental programming practices via a programming curriculum which utilizes JavaScript, Lua, 
                   C#, Makecode Arcade, and Unity. <br/> In the summer months I ran daily and weekly STEM camps specializing in Lua and how to create 
                   complex environments in Roblox Studio.
